Loan Default Prediction System

Project Overview
The Loan Default Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based project that predicts whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan or not.

This system helps banks and financial institutions reduce risk by analyzing customer details such as income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, and other financial factors to make better lending decisions.

Problem Statement
Loan defaults cause financial losses for banks and lenders. Traditional methods of checking loan eligibility may not always accurately identify risky customers.

This project aims to build a predictive model that can classify borrowers as:

Low Risk (Loan will be repaid)
High Risk (Possible Loan Default)
